// Conflicts are returned, if a request was made with a consistency token, and a conflict to the requested action was caused.
// There are three states:
//  - WAS - the state expected to be the newest by the frontend as identified by the consistency token,
//  - WANT - the state resulting from applying the changes requested)
//  - IS - the true current state, which only differs from WAS if another action was performed since the client retrieved the WAS state
// If WAS == IS, or WANT and IS are merge-able (e.g., requested action changes "name", and another action has changed "age"), no conflict arises.
