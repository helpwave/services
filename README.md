# services
    
helpwave's microservices

## Getting started

1. [Install](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) and [run](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/) Dapr locally
2. Most of our services require a database. Run `dev/docker-compose.yaml` to set up a basic postgres database
   > Postgres username and password: `postgres`:`postgres`

   > pgAdmin username and password: `tech@helpwave.de`:`tech@helpwave.de`
3. Go to your [services/](services/) of choice `cd services/<service>/`
4. Copy the environment variables of `.env.example` to '.env' and configure them
5. Run `./migrate.sh task-svc up` to run the migrations or do it manually by [installing migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
6. Run the service
   > Most of our services can be run via `go run main.go`. In the future, we will provide some more convenient ways to setup all services directly via Dapr.
7. For direct client to service requests via gRPC, add the following metadata to your requests:
	- `X-Organization: [An organization id. Most requests are performed on the side of an organization. The id must be part of your passed access token]`
	- `dapr-app-id: [the app id of the targeted service]`

### Fake token

When working with services that use auth, instead of dealing with JWTs, you can make use of fake tokens.
A fake token is only the claims part of a JWT, which are defined [here](libs/common/auth.go#L37).
You can create your own by simply base64-encoding your json claims.

Use the environment variable `INSECURE_FAKE_TOKEN_ENABLE=true` for a service to accept fake-tokens.
Only do this in development environments!

Fake tokens are used just like JWTs: As bearer tokens in the Authorization header of your gRPC requests.

Here is an example fake-token that can be used as the bearer authorization token.

## Docker images

You can build a docker image for a service using `make`:
```bash
make <servicename>
```
 e.g.:
```bash
 make user-svc
```

Each service should have a Makefile, that includes the root's Makefile.
In the context of a service directory you should be able to use
```bash
 make this
```
to build the corresponding docker image as well.

### Our images

#### Dockerfile.apisix

This image includes our APISX configuration and the daprd process. As in `Dockerfile.standalone`,
these two processes are running side by side in the container via [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind). 

#### Dockerfile.service

This image contains "just" the service. The Dapr sidecar needs to be deployed separately.

#### Dockerfile.standalone

This image contains the service including the daprd sidecar. These two processes are running
side by side in the container via [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind).

## Migrations
We use [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) to handle changes to our database tables
It uses change versioning, e.g.
- `000009_some_name.up.sql` contains all changes from version 8 to 9
- `000009_some_name.down.sql` contains all changes from version 9 to 8 in reverse order from
```
migrate -path services/<service>/migrations/ -database postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/<service>?sslmode=disable up [version]
migrate -path services/<service>/migrations/ -database postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/<service>?sslmode=disable down [version]
```

### `migrate.sh` - Running migrate/migrate inside docker

_Recommended_

If you don't want to install migrate/migrate directly on your machine, you can use our `migrate.sh` script.
This script automatically discovers the migration folder and env file and passes them alongside
you arguments into migrate/migrate running in a container.

`migrate.sh` will use the database setup of the passed service. Therefore, a .env file is required.

#### Usage
`./migrate.sh <service> [... arguments for migrate/migrate]`

- `<service>` must be one of the services inside `/services/`
- `[... arguments for migrate/migrate]` gets passed directly to migrate/migrate


#### Examples:
- Migrate the task-svc database all the way up `./migrate.sh task-svc up`
- Migrate the task-svc database one down: `./migrate.sh task-svc down 1`
- Current migration version of the task-svc database: `./migrate.sh task-svc version`

#### desired:
Additionally, the script allows you to query the highest available migration version
based on the migration files available in the service:

```bash
./migrate <service> desired
```

## Enviroment variables
Every service should contain a `.env.example` file which should be copied to a usable `.env` file

Default Variables:
```
# The mode used, options available
#  development, production
MODE=development

# The following levels are available:
#  trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# The port on which the the service will listen on (default: 8080)
PORT=8080

# Database Related Configurations
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=postgres

# For development purposes
INSECURE_FAKE_TOKEN_ENABLE=true
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=425f8b8d-c786-4ff7-b2bf-e52f505fb588

# Variables with the prefix "SECRETSTORE_" will be catched up by the current env secret store
SECRETSTORE_REDIS_HOST=localhost
SECRETSTORE_REDIS_USERNAME=
SECRETSTORE_REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

## Temporary advises

### Example for service to service communication via Dapr and gRPC

```go
// ...

daprClient := common.MustNewDaprGRPCClient()

organizationSvc := user_svc.NewOrganizationServiceClient(daprClient.GrpcClientConn())
ctx, cancel := common.PrepCtxForSvcToSvcCall(ctx, "user-svc")
defer cancel()

res, err := organizationSvc.CreateOrganizationForUser(ctx, &user_svc.CreateOrganizationForUserRequest{
	LongName:     fmt.Sprintf("%s personal organization", payload.Nickname),
	ShortName:    payload.Nickname,
	ContactEmail: payload.Email,
	IsPersonal:   true,
	UserId:       userID.String(),
})

if err != nil {
	return nil, status.Error(codes.Internal, err.Error())
}
```

### Arm versioning

[We disarmed the versioning for pre-production.](https://github.com/helpwave/services/issues/125).
To arm the versioning, search for "arm-versioning" in the codebase.

## Deployment
